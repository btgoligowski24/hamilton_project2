# hamilton_project2

Welcome party planners!  This application was designed to serve as a launching point for people looking to get started on planning their next big event.  

The user starts out at the home page where they can choose to either view existing party themes or build a theme of their own.  

If the user chooses to 'view existing themes', they will be guided to a secondary page that suggests a number of different, predefined party themes taken from popular drink or food combinations.  

If the user opts to 'build a theme' from the home page, a modal will display asking them to input a creative theme title and name.  From here, the user is directed to a 'build' page where they can make selections based on applicable searches or categories provided.  The food or drink selections chosen by the user are then stored under the themes title section that populated upon page load, so the user may reference as they build.  Once the user has entered all of their selections, they can save the theme within their session, allowing them to be viewed under the 'existing themes' page.

The project uses the following front end technologies: bootstrap, animate, HTML/CSS, handlebars, javascript, jquery.

The project uses the following back end technologies: express, node.js, sequelize, jquery, javascript, mealsDB (API), cocktailsDB (API), mySQL.
